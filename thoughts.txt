[2019/04/08 01:37:22] %llvm, %ll2w, %regalloc, %liveness
;	It *seems* I've gotten liveness calculation working. (The papers I got the algorithms from didn't really have
;	many examples, so I'm not entirely sure whether my implementation is correct.) Now I need to do register
;	allocation.
;	In l6.pdf:11, I think "multiple reaching definitions" refers to phi instructions. Say you have this code:

		; <label>:39:    ; preds = %33
		%40 = load ...
		br label %43

		; <label>:41:    ; preds = %33
		%42 = load ...
		br label %43

		; <label>:43:    ; preds = %41, %39
		%44 = phi i8* [%40, %39], [%42, %41]

;	I think this means that %40, %42 and %44 would all be merged into the same equivalence class. The way to deal
;	with phi functions is by simply making sure the source variables use the same register, and putting them into
;	one equivalence class would accomplish this.

[2019/04/08 01:45:37] %llvm, %ll2w, %regalloc
;	disassemble.ll has two (very similar) examples of phi instructions (I used one of them in the previous entry).
;	Probably the best of all the .ll files, honestly. Phi functions seem pretty rare!
;	There are only a couple occurrences among all the .ll files I have here.
